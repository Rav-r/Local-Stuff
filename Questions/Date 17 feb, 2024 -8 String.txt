Coding is cool. Format your code is better !

You can format variables’ name using 3 big formats:
- camelCase : The words are not separated, everything is in lower case except the first letter of each word (except the 1st word).
- PascalCase: The words are not separated, everything is in lower case except the first letter of each word.
- snake_case: The words are separated by ‘_’, everything is in lower case.

Formatting a large number of variables is a tedious task. Let's automate it!
Input
Line 1 : A string for the variable’s name. Made of alphanumeric characters and space to separate words.
Line 2 : A string for the format you need to use: camelCase, PascalCase or snake_case
Output
Line 1 : The name of the variable correctly formatted
Constraints
1 <= name’s length <= 100
Example
Input

MY Super variABLE
camelCase

Output

mySuperVariable
